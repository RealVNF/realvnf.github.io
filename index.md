# A Software Campus project

RealVNF is a 2-year project (11/2018 to 10/2020) that is funded by the BMBF and part of the [Software Campus](https://www.softwarecampus.de/en/), which means that the entire project is managed and lead by a PhD student - here, Stefan Schneider from Paderborn University, Germany.

The goal of the project is to design and develop concepts and algorithms to improve coordination of chained virtual network functions (VNFs) under realistic conditions to take cloud computing and network softwarization to the next level.

In collaboration with Huawei, we try to focus on practical applicability and usefulness, while combining it with new research ideas and approaches. A current focus is on combining classical networking with deep reinforcement learning approaches.

As the project evolves, this website will be updated continuously to point to published papers or open-source code. So stay tuned!
